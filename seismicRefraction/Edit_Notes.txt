    SeismicReadnSort3.py (shortend to SRS) takes in the test#.cvs not the sortjunk1.cvs 
    There is no github repo atm but I have a local git repository and will start editing this file
    I am going to start by making it a Class
    I don't think it will be possible for this to have seperation between Controll and View

    I is now a Class
    I also moved that wierd loop thing that was under run() into ReadFile, along with the ability
        to select multiple files at once.

    There are a lot of varibles that are just not used, I will delete them later when I'm sure that 
        the data from my edits are correct
